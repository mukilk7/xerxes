== FILES ==

1. generator.py

Main script that generates worker nodes' load specification files from
global load specification parameters specified in loadspec.conf.

2. loadspec.conf

Global load specification parameters. Each parameter in the file has a
comment line above it explaining it.

---

Workflow:

1. Configure loadspec.conf for generating worker node load specs from
either (i) datacenter machine resource usage traces or (ii)
statistical distributions. Please do not enable both at the same time.

2. Configure "spike" section if required.

3. Run generator.py with loadspec.conf as input.

4. Each individual node's load spec file will be generated as
"node<num>.dat" in the specified output folder.
