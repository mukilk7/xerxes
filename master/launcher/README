1. shipfiles.py

Ships files and folders in parallel to nodes specified in a hostfile, to the
desired location. It can also be used to ship load specification files
to worker nodes. IF used in this mode it will use the node logical
number information from the host file to ship to each node the load
spec file pertaining to that node. Note that the load spec file
destination path in the remote node has to be the same location where
the setupcron.sh script and the wileE load generation benchmark were
installed.

2. shipspecs.conf

Configuration parameters for shipfiles.py. Each parameter has a
comment line on top of it explaining it. Customize this and pass as
input to shipfiles.py.

3. launch.py

ssh's into worker nodes and uses the setupcron.sh script to setup
local load generation at a specific time. All nodes will start at the
same time as long as NTP has been setup to sync with the master
(out-of-band). It also gives you the ability to stop each node's load
generation at a specific time if you don't want it to work through
each line in the load spec file till the end.

4. launchspec.conf

Configuration parameters for launch.py. Each parameter has a
comment line on top of it explaining it. Customize this and pass as
input to launch.py.
